#How do you spell it lol
a = 0
b = 1

for i in range(100):
    print(a)
    a,b = b,b+a

#You know, i laugh at how easy it is to do this.
#When i first started, i thought OH I'LL NEED A THIRD VARIABLE KNOWN AS C!
#But then after a meme shown me i can swap variables, i wondered if i could perform math at the same time.
#Meaning that it takes 5 lines of code, roughly.
